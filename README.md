This project is a simple console-based banking system implemented in Python. It allows users to create bank accounts, log in using a username and PIN, and perform basic banking operations such as depositing, withdrawing, viewing balances, and transferring funds between accounts. The project consists of two classes, "User" and "Bank," which manage user information and account transactions. Users can create accounts, log in securely, and perform various banking actions through a menu-driven interface.
